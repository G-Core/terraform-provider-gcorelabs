# gcore_lifecyclepolicy (Resource)

Represent lifecycle policy. Use to periodically take snapshots

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider gcore {
  permanent_api_token = "251$d3361.............1b35f26d8"
}

resource "gcore_lifecyclepolicy" "lp" {
  project_id = 1
  region_id  = 1
  name       = "test"
  status     = "active"
  action     = "volume_snapshot"
  volume {
    id = "fe93bfdd-4ce3-4041-b89b-4f10d0d49498"
  }
  schedule {
    max_quantity           = 4
    interval {
      weeks   = 1
      days    = 2
      hours   = 3
      minutes = 4
    }
    resource_name_template = "reserve snap of the volume {volume_id}"
    retention_time {
      weeks   = 4
      days    = 3
      hours   = 2
      minutes = 1
    }
  }
