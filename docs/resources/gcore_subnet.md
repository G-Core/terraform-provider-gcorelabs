# gcore_subnet (Resource)

Represent subnets. Subnetwork is a range of IP addresses in a cloud network. Addresses from this range will be assigned to machines in the cloud

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider gcore {
  permanent_api_token = "251$d3361.............1b35f26d8"
}

resource "gcore_network" "network" {
  name       = "network_example"
  mtu        = 1450
  type       = "vxlan"
  region_id  = 1
  project_id = 1
}

resource "gcore_subnet" "subnet" {
  name            = "subnet_example"
  cidr            = "192.168.10.0/24"
  network_id      = gcore_network.network.id
  dns_nameservers = var.dns_nameservers

  dynamic host_routes {
    iterator = hr
    for_each = var.host_routes
    content {
      destination = hr.value.destination
      nexthop     = hr.value.nexthop
    }
  }

  gateway_ip = "192.168.10.1"
  region_id  = 1
  project_id = 1
}
```

- `project_id` (Number)
- `project_name` (String)
- `region_id` (Number)
- `region_name` (String)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `metadata_read_only` (List of Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata_read_only))

<a id="nestedblock--host_routes"></a>
### Nested Schema for `host_routes`

Required:

- `destination` (String)
- `nexthop` (String) IPv4 address to forward traffic to if it's destination IP matches 'destination' CIDR


<a id="nestedatt--metadata_read_only"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata_read_only`

Read-Only:

- `key` (String)
- `read_only` (Boolean)
- `value` (String)
